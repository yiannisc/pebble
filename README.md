# pebble-spoken-time
This is a watchface for a Pebble Smartwatch.
It only works on the original Pebble and Pebble Steel.
It does not work on the Pebble Time.

It shows the time as if somebody answers the question: "What is the time?"
Nobody says "six zero zero". They say "six o'clock".
People don't say "six forty six", but "a quarter to seven".
I never say "three twent eight". I say "nearly half past eight".
